\section{Components mapping on Requirements}

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{3cm}|p{10cm}|}
	\hline
	\bf{Comp.} & \bf{Requirements} & \bf{Reason} \\
	\hline
	\hline
	AS & R* & Application server is needed for all the functionalities as it is the foundation for the system\\
	\hline
	APP & R1-9,R11-13 & Mobile APP is the medium for the communication between the user and the system \\
	\hline
	RT & R1-3,R5-9,R11-12 & Router is the middleware component for the "frontend" functionalities.\\
	\hline
	AT & R1-4 & Authentication Service allows to check the state of the user (e.g. Active, Pending or Guest)\\
	\hline
	GE & R5,R11-12 & Geo Service is the service that allows to show the items on the map and apply filters based on the user's location\\
	\hline
	BS & R6-10,R13 & Booking Service manages the "state machine" and the related effects for the charging sessions.\\
	\hline
	NS & R13 & It allows to communicate with the external service providers\\
	\hline
	PS & R10 & It allows to communicate with the Payment Service Provider\\
	\hline
	OC & R5-12,R14 & It allows the bidirectional communication with the various CPMS\\
	\hline
	OR & R* & It allows to easily access the DBMS APIs and to manage the relationships between the models.\\
	\hline
	MD & R* & It allows to access the ORM interfaces and to trigger functions on models' events (e.g. send a notification when charging is completed) \\
