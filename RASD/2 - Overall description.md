## 2.1.1 - Scenarios 

### 1. User wants to start a charge at the station
Bob goes to a station and wants to start charging his vehicle, with a booking for that time frame, 
he simply needs to park the car in the correct spot, connect it with the correct plug and enable the charge
flow via the app. Without a booking, he needs to look for an available spot via the app and start a booking
process for it.

### 2. CPO wants to change the price of the energy sold
Alice is the administrator of a charging station and has decided to increase the price of energy. Alice opens the internet portal of her CPMS via a browser. By entering the credentials, Alice accesses the interface concerning the proposed price. After a careful analysis, Alice changes the price and presses the "Save Changes" button.

### 3. CPO wants to disable a charging socket to perform maintenance
Fabio is a maintenance technician at a charging station and has to carry out routine checks on the correct functioning of a charging socket. Fabio opens the internet portal of her CPMS via a browser. By entering the credentials, Fabio accesses the booking interface. Fabio selects an available time slot and presses the "Maintenance" button.

## 2.2 - Product functions

In this section the main functionalities of the CPMS is presented and described in more detail.

### 2.2.1 Dynamically decide the energy source to use
The dynamic management of the needed energy resources is one of the CPMS's main responsibilities. It should also be able to dynamically decide from which DSO to acquire energy based on the current price and energy source mix, and decide whether to store or use energy from the station's batteries. 

### 2.2.2 Communicate information to the various eMSPs
The system must be able to communicate via the OCPI protocol with the various eMSPs that make port on the network. Through this protocol, the two actors will be able to communicate information such as: position of the charging stations managed by the CPO, rates offered, availability for reservations, type of charging available. 

### 2.2.3 CPOs, station monitoring and management
It must be possible to monitor and display information such as: tariffs offered, current cost of energy purchased from DSOs, battery status, reservation shedules. Furthermore, the admin must be able, through a dedicated portal, to make changes and decisions on the management of the station.

### 2.2.4 Manage the reservations shedule
The system should be able to manage and keep track of the reservations that are made by the various eMSPs. The system must be able to handle the modification, if possible, or cancellation of reservations.

### 2.2.5 Interaction with DSOs
The system must be able to communicate with the various Distribution Management Systems (DSOs). The system must be able to request information such as: energy price, energy type. It must also be able to request connection and supply of energy from each DSO.

###Â 2.2.6 Communication with the charging slots
The system should be able to communicate with the charging slots present in each charging point. communication must take place via the OCPP protocol. The exchange of information such as: diagnostic data, charging status, activation of the charging socket must take place through this protocol.
