## About the Project
Electric mobility (e-Mobility) is a way to limit the carbon footprint caused by our urban and suburban mobility needs. The software plays a key role in e-Mobility, as it allows users to find charging stations, book a charge, start the charging process, and pay for the service. The software also helps charging point operators (CPOs) to manage their charging stations, such as acquiring energy from external sources, deciding the cost of a charging, and setting special offers.

The main benefits of the software are:

It helps users to find charging stations easily and book a charge in advance.
It helps CPOs to manage their charging stations more efficiently.
It allows users to pay for the service conveniently.
The interaction between the various providers (eMSPs, CPOs, and DSOs) occurs through uniform APIs. This allows users to exploit a large variety of charging options.

In summary, the software is essential for the successful adoption of e-Mobility. It helps users to find charging stations, book a charge, start the charging process, and pay for the service. It also helps CPOs to manage their charging stations more efficiently.
